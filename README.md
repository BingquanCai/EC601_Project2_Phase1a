## Twitter & Twitter API

Twitter is a platform that provides real-time events and hot topics for discussion around the world today. On Twitter, real-time commentary conversations show every side of the story from breaking news, entertainment messages, sports news, political news, to everyday information in an all-encompassing way. Here, you can join open and real-time conversations or even watch live events.

The Twitter API can be used to programmatically retrieve and analyze data, as well as engage with the conversation on Twitter. This API provides access to a variety of different resources including the following: Tweets, Users, Direct Messages, Lists, Trends, Media, Places.

## Get tweets of the user - by timeline

In the Twitter_API.py that I upload, I import tweepy to help me achieve the function I want to accomplish. Tweepy is a module designed to handle the Twitter API in Python in a fairly simple way.

I use api.user_timeline() to get tweets of the user by timeline. In the api.user_timeline(), I can type in the id of whomever I want and specify the number of tweets.
